# k8s notes
These are my notes about Kubernetes from [LFS58x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+3T2020/course/) and the various Kubernetes docs to help me learn about [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and get a [CKAD](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/).
Hopefully they help you too.
